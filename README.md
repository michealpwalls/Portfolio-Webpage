portfolio
========================

 This repository holds my Portfolio, an online (Web accessible) Portfolio.
 
 Using modern HTML5, CSS3 styling, JQuery, JQuery Mobile and PHP5 the design is Responsive, adapting to many different screen sizes. In addition to the Responsive design, the Portfolio is fully Mobile-Aware with a targetted
 mobile App (mobile.html)
 
 The Desktop website uses the Open Source detectmobilebrowsers.js library to detect mobile browsers
 and redirect users to the Mobile app.
 
 A nomobile override exists for the Desktop website (index.html?nomobile=true) to fascilitate switching
 from Desktop to Mobile easily.
